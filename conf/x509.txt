Key usage extensions and extended key usage
from an IBM page
=========================================================================

Key usage extensions

Key usage extensions define the purpose of the public key contained in a certificate. You
can use them to restrict the public key to as few or as many operations as needed. For
example, if you have a key used only for signing or verifying a signature, enable the
digital signature and/or non-repudiation extensions. Alternatively, if a key is used
only for key management, enable key encipherment.

The following table describes the key usage extensions available for certificates
created using the CA process.

Note The digital signature and data encipherment key usage extensions are enabled by
default for all Internet certificates.

	Digital signature
		
		Use when the public key is used with a digital signature mechanism
		to support security services other than non-repudiation, certificate
		signing, or CRL signing. A digital signature is often used for entity
		authentication and data origin authentication with integrity.

	Non-repudiation

		Use when the public key is used to verify digital signatures used to
		provide a non-repudiation service. Non-repudiation protects against the
		signing entity falsely denying some action (excluding certificate or
		CRL signing).

	Key encipherment

		Use when a certificate will be used with a protocol that encrypts keys. An
		example is S/MIME enveloping, where a fast (symmetric) key is encrypted
		with the public key from the certificate. SSL protocol also performs
		key encipherment.

	Data encipherment
		
		Use when the public key is used for encrypting user data, other than
		cryptographic keys.

	Key agreement

		Use when the sender and receiver of the public key need to derive the
		key without using encryption. This key can then can be used to encrypt
		messages between the sender and receiver. Key agreement is typically
		used with Diffie-Hellman ciphers.

	Certificate signing

		Use when the subject public key is used to verify a signature on
		certificates. This extension can be used only in CA certificates.

	CRL signing

		Use when the subject public key is to verify a signature on revocation
		information, such as a CRL.

	Encipher only

		Use only when key agreement is also enabled. This enables the public
		key to be used only for enciphering data while performing key agreement.

	Decipher only

		Use only when key agreement is also enabled. This enables the public
		key to be used only for deciphering data while performing key agreement.


Extended key usage

Extended key usage further refines key usage extensions. An extended key is either
critical or non-critical. If the extension is critical, the certificate must be used
only for the indicated purpose or purposes. If the certificate is used for another
purpose, it is in violation of the CA's policy.

If the extension is non-critical, it indicates the intended purpose or purposes of
the key and may be used in finding the correct key/certificate of an entity that has
multiple keys/certificates. The extension is then only an informational field and does
not imply that the CA restricts use of the key to the purpose indicated. Nevertheless,
applications that use certificates may require that a particular purpose be indicated
in order for the certificate to be acceptable.

If a certificate contains both a critical key usage field and a critical extended key
usage field, both fields must be processed independently, and the certificate be used
only for a purpose consistent with both fields. If there is no purpose consistent with
both fields, the certificate must not be used for any purpose.

Extended key                          Enable for these key usage extensions
